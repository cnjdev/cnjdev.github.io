Welcome to my GitHub Page!

My name is Nikitas Marangos. I am a web developer with about 10 years of experience working on JAVA web applications running on Tomcat servers. I used primarily core Java, JavaScript, CSS, and SQL as well as JSON, ExtJS, JSP, and HTML.

In November 2017, I earned a Certificate in Web Development from the Rutgers Division of Continuing Studies where I learned more JavaScript, CSS, and MySQL, learned technologies like jQuery, Node.js, Express, Bootstrap, Handlebars, and MongoDB, and learned to use various APIs from around the web.
